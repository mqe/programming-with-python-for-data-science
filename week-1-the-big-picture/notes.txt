--- Data analysis process ---

- Collecting data from various sources
- Wrangling data to make it more reliable
- Exploring data using statistics and visualizations
- Transforming data to prepare it for modeling
- Modeling data using the appropriate machine learning algorithms
- Evaluating the results of the data models

--- Machine Learning ---

Generalizable algorithms to complete tasks (i.e. solve problems) by examining data, in comparison with hard coding specific instructions.

Unsupervised learning:
	Collected data without instructions to find patterns and outliers.
	- Clustering (automatically group similar samples into sets)
	- Dimensionality reduction (reduce the number of features in a dataset)

Supervised learning:
	Applying rules and conditions to collected data to produce results.
	- Classification (anti-spam)
	- Regression (predicting continuous-valued, i.e. small changes in input data results in small changes in the output)

Reinforcement learning:
	To maximize reward/ or minimize cost for a function (balancing cost and reward).
	- Learn how to beat video games
	- Automate trading of stocks and securities
