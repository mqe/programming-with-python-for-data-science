--- Features ---

	Attribute:
		Features are a quantitative attributes of the samples being observed
	
	Axis:
		Features are orthogonal axes of their feature space, if they are linearly independent

	Column:
		Features are represented as columns in your dataset

	Dimension:
		A dataset's features, grouped together can be treated as a n-dimensional coordinate space

	Input:
		Feature values are the input of data-driven, machine learning algorithms

	Predictor:
		Features used to predict other attributes are called predictors

	View:
		Each feature conveys a quantitative trait or perspective about the sample being observed

	Independent Variable:
		Autonomous features used to calculate others are like independent variables in algebraic equations
