    "Isomap operates by first computing each record's nearest neighbors. This is done by comparing each sample to every other sample in the dataset. Only a sample's K-nearest samples qualify for being included in its nearest-neighborhood samples list. A neighborhood graph is then constructed by linking each sample to its K-nearest neighbors. The result is similar to map of roads that is traversed in order to move from point to point."

    "The straightforward, e.g. high-dimensional, direct Euclidean distance between any two records fails to properly account for any intrinsic, nonlinear geometry present within your dataset's features. Isomap is able to intelligently recover and estimate a lower-dimensional embedding, also known as a manifold, by traversing the shortest distances between samples, hopping along through the calculated neighborhood map. It is with this map that Isomap calculates a projection, or reduced dimensional embedding that represents your dataset through multi-dimensional scaling."
